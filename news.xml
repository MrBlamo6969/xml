*This Help Page is hosted online and will be auto updated when i change things.
(Check the top for the current app version released.)

*Check out the Quick Help section if you need more information or help thats not here.

*Need help or wanna contact me for any other reaaon? feel free to email me.
(If you would like a custom list or anything added to the app then hit me up.)
 
*Wanna shut this Help option off and remove it from the Main Menu?
(Goto settings and disable the Help Dialog lol. app looks better without it.)
 
*Clear the Cache every once in a while. Its in the app Settings under its own Tab.
(Once a week or month is Advised. If the app laggs alot then it might be time. I clear mine every day but thats me.)

*Little trick that works most the time is to click play on the same item again after it fails.
---The second attempt usually pulls with less work and can find a source easier. 
(Doesn't work 100% of the time. meant for stuff that you know should be available.)
---Also for when you find those 'rare' mismatch items to watch/play.
(like the movie 'Unforgiven' by C. Eastwood from 1992 gets scrambled with the 2013 Japanese one by Lee Sang.)
(another is TV Show 'Bunnicula' has messed up season lists in alot of addons and plays the wrong episode sometimes.)

*Addons like this one and many others are quite busy doing alot of stressful stuff. take your time and be chill.
(Try to imagine a 3-5 second cooldown timer after any command is done to help prevent errors and crashes.)

*TMDB is slow at loading most the time so other sources are advised. Also depends on list sizes.
(In my mind show source speeds go TvMaze, Trakt, then TMDB and IMDB. I choose them in that order as well.)
 
*If you click something and your sitting around still waiting after 2 minutes have passed, then its probably safe to say that the choice failed.
(Could also be a Cache issue. Unless your just too high and didnt even click anything but thought you did lol. which can happens quite often.)



-----Settings-----
-The Settings for this app are(should be) set up as a 2 click auto play. 1st one to start the process, 2nd for hd/sd choice.
-The Meta Settings are optional and you can turn em on or off depending on how you want em. id leave it how it is tho.
-Want to choose the site you watch from? Enable the link selection dialog Setting in the Scrapers Tab.
-The link selection fallthrough Setting in the Scrapers Tab is very handy and advised to stay Enabled.
-In the Settings Resolvers Tab there are a few options you can Enable in the 'Filtering Options' if you want more streaming sources.
(I keep all the Filtering Options Disabled personally. Those are the sources that need you pair your shit.)
(sometimes one might slip through the fliter, just hit cancel if it happens.)
-The API Settings are important and already setup with my API's. Dont remove them unless you have your own to put in.
